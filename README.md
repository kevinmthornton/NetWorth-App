NetWorth-App
============

This is a work in progress. This a is a 'vanity' app that allows you to track the stocks that you own and see the value 
of those stocks any time you open the app. You can add, edit, and delete each stock.

A call goes out to the yahoo server for quotes for symbols that are stored in Core Data. For each symbol, the change and close prices are retrieved and displayed to calculate your net worth for that day.
